Premise: You are an angelic corgi fighting your way through hell and demonic corgis to retrieve the Holy Bone.

Gameplay: It is a mixture of 3D platforming and Boss fights where the each is done in 3 segments.

While platforming, you must avoid dropping into the lava or getting hit by fireballs or you die.

During the boss fights, avoid the fireballs the boss shoots out while depleting the boss's HP.

Controls: WASD is used for movement in both phases while space is used to jump during platforming 
and mouse left click is used to shoot fireballs of your own.
