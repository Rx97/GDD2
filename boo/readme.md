Premise: You are Luigi and you have become lost in the woods. All you have is a flashlight with limited batteries and must collect coins
to purchase stars while avoiding Boos to return home.

Gameplay: You will explore a dark spooky environment in search of spare batteries, coins and shops.
You must collect coins to purchase a total of 3 stars from the shops to safely return home.
Shops are randomly spawned in and will randomly relocate after each purchase and you must explore the woods to find them.

There will be patroling Boos that you must avoid otherwise if they catch you, the game will end.

Controls: WASD is used for movement and left click can be used to toggle the brightness of the flashlight between off, dim, and bright.
